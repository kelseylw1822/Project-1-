// Problem : Provide students with a self-assessment tool they can use to determine if and for how long they must isolate

// main

    // declare variable for Covid test result and date of test

    // read in input if user tested positive or negative

    // if result is positive, then prompt user they must isolate for 7 days from date of test REGARDLESS

    // if result is negative and they were not exposed, then prompt user they do not have to isolate

    // if result is negative and they were exposed:

        // declare two Date class varibles for the date they were exposed and when they recieved their second dose
    
        // read in input for variables

        // pass the date they were exposed and date they recieved their second dose to function CalcDays

        // determine studen'ts vaccination status at time of exposure from what was returned

            // if they were fully vacinated by time of exposure, then prompt user that they need to isolate for 3 days from the day of exposure
            
            // if they were not fully vacinated by time of exposure, then prompt user they need to isolate for 12 days from day of exposure

// create Date class.

    // create constructor with day, month, year

    // prompt user for input
    
    // if input is invalid, constructor should set all variables to default value


// create function calcDays that takes in two Date class parameters
    
    // declare two varaibles for date1 and date2

    // assign on parameter to date1 and the other to date2

    // calculate the days between 1/01/2023 and date1

    // calculate the days between 1/01/2023 and date2

    // calculate the difference between date1 and date2
    
    // return the total amount of days
